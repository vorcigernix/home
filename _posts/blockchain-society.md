There are studies, like [this one](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10043048/1/Aste_BlockchainIEEE_600W_v3.3_A.doccceptedVersion.x.pdf), that are trying to map an impact of blockchain on the society already. Most of them focus on the transaction and governance abilities and while these are important, I think that there are some socio-economical implications missing and I'd like to address them in this article.

Most important aspects I consider missing are distribution of wealth and releted distribution of power. I think that both are intertwined and symptomatic for both is that they don't fit well into "world is simply better with blockchain" simplification. My goal is not to dismiss the positive impact of technology on our lives though, if you look for another Manifesto, you will have to look elsewhere.



## Distribution of wealth

If you study a sociology, you know that a big part of society function is revolving around the way we structure the society and the structure of society is mostly driven by wealth. Even in societies that put a different structure in place of wealth and they try to create a "better world" by building society on top of religious or other structures, wealth creeps in as a result of power. But let's focus on wealth itself.

In most of societies today, no matter how they label themselves, we see an increasing gap distribution of wealth towards the people that are already wealthy. I am wring person to explain this, but the core of the function is simple: if you can spend the money to invest, you jump off the deadly spiral that our govenments are creating for a very good reason. Spiral is called inflation and if you are lucky enough to invest into the assets that do not decrease in value, your wealth is slowly but surely increasing. More you have, more you can invest and this create these big gaps we see in the current wealth distribution. I'll return to the reasons why the governments are doing this later and you will be suprised how well it fits into "The road to hell is paved with good intentions" proverb.

But here comes blockchain, as a technology that can create artificial limited resources. Or artificial resources in general. It is not a new concept though, bonds and shares are very similar and while their value was bound originally to something more tangible, like company performance, now they are very similar to cryptocurrencies in a way their value is perceived. The concept that is new in this scale is a volatility and rapic increase of value over time. This opens a door to increased wealth of some social groups that wouldn't profit from investment to shares in a short to medium term. There is the new upper middle class born from the blockchain technology and the size of this gruoup is rising with every major shift of the cryptocurrencies valuation against fiat currencies. There are people loosing money too, but their impact on society is minimal, I don't see any major group moving from middle class lower because of some lost savings or similar.

This is joined by people that are already wealthy, they would nver miss the chance to increase the wealth and question of those moving majority of assets to blockchain based assets is not if, but when. For sake of simplicity, I'd group institutional money with wealthy people money ad they act very similarly. So what we see is two groups moving in the direction of increased wealth. While "already wealthy" group remain roughly same in a size, the new uper class do have an impact on existing wealth distribution and thus impact on society.

What would be the impact? This very much depends on where you are on the ladder now. The option to have a whole bitcoin is moving away from significant part of population, no matter the peaks and "dips". In some parts of the world, it is already very hard goal to reach. For another big chunk of the world, 100k USD/BTC price would be this breaking point. For people that cannot get the significant amount of BTC now the impact depends on their situation. 
Here, the government part. If you are a young person, especially family, you either have a substantial debt already or you will create one in order to get the properties associated with some social norm. This is happening across the world and this is an engine of economic growth and motivation. People in debt generally profits from inflation, their debt is getting smaller and the money they are earning are getting higher. As I mentioned earlier, governments use the inflation in order to achive exactly this effect. This all is paid by "savers". Companies and governments developed a great number of strategies they use to incentivize people to keep money in various forms of saving accounts. It could be called risk insurance, life insurance, investment bank accounts - you name it. Common denominator here is that you are suppost to "earn money" by saving. Some state sponsored and mandatory savings works the same way and you can hate it as much as you can, but you are putting your money into these systems. And older or more wealthy you are, more you help the young indebted people. Which is nice. 
Until the older and more wealthy have an option to get part of wealth out of this cycle. In the moment the significant part of this group decide to move the assets to shares or cryptocurrencies or NFTs or basically anything outside of the system, the cycle as descibed above, collapse. The loans are continually created from a thin air and new money are "created" in order to cover for the assets that disappeared from the system. Which spin the inflation spiral even further, making indebted people super happy and people with "savings" super angry and looking for an options to escape the system.
